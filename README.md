Taking notes by hand is a highly practical approach to grasp topics, and this method of learning can make it simpler for students to remember the material. But everything has a downside, so handwritten notes are only beneficial if they are stored neatly and carefully; otherwise, damaged pages and pages that seem unclean cannot be used for very long. To preserve them secure and current until the very last minute in a drive, the project concept of turning handwritten papers into digital ones came into mind. Thus, converting written characters to digital representation is becoming more and more common. The words on a piece of paper will eventually fade away, while a file kept on a computer can only be lost by deletion. It has become crucial to save any handwritten documents in digital format. This introduces us to the concept of handwriting to text conversion. This project aims to develop a robust and efficient system for converting handwritten text into digital text using advanced machine learning techniques. It is centered on leveraging machine learning techniques to create a system capable of converting written text into digital form so as to enhance accessibility and digitization of handwritten documents, making them readily usable in digital environments. The primary goal is to bridge the gap between traditional written documents and digital text, facilitating easier information retrieval and analysis. The project involves the development of a model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accurately recognize and transcribe handwritten characters. The end goal is to provide a user-friendly solution with real-time processing capabilities, ensuring versatility across different handwriting styles and languages.
Systems that read handwritten letters, characters, and numbers enable humans to complete complicated tasks that would otherwise be time consuming and expensive to complete.
